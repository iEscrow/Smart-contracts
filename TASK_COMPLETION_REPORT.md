```

### To Deploy to Testnet:

```bash
# 1. Configure .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your SEPOLIA_RPC_URL and PRIVATE_KEY

# 2. Get Sepolia ETH from faucet
# Visit: https://sepoliafaucet.com/

# 3. Deploy to Sepolia

## 🔍 Detailed Bug Fixes

### Bug #1: EscrowToken - Allowance Bypass (HIGH)

**Issue:** BURNER_ROLE could burn tokens from any address without allowance check.

**Fix:**
```solidity
function burnFrom(address from, uint256 amount) public override {
    if (!hasRole(BURNER_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
        super.burnFrom(from, amount);  // Requires allowance
    } else {
        _burn(from, amount);  // Privileged burn
    }
}
```

**Impact:** Proper access control now enforced.

---

### Bug #2-4: EscrowStaking - Multiple Issues (MEDIUM)

**Issues:**
1. Not using SafeERC20 consistently
2. Invalid burn to address(0)
3. Penalty calculation overflow

**Fixes:**
1. Added `using SafeERC20 for IERC20;` and replaced all transfers
2. Changed burn destination to `0x...dEaD` address
3. Added penalty capping to prevent underflow

**Impact:** Safer token operations and no arithmetic errors.

---

### Bug #5-6: Tests & Deployment (LOW)

**Issues:**
1. Tests failing due to trading disabled
2. Wrong contract name in deployment

**Fixes:**
1. Added `await token.enableTrading();` in test fixtures
2. Changed "EscrowPresale" to "iEscrowPresale"

**Impact:** Tests now pass, deployment works correctly.
