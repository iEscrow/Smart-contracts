# Project Progress Summary: Treasury Contract for Founders, Team, and Advisors

Hey! I'll document what we've accomplished so far in this project, along with what's left to do. I'll keep it simple and clear, like a quick overview anyone can read. This is based on our discussions and the code we've reviewed in your `tresary_contract` (treasury contract) project.

## What We've Done So Far
We've focused on understanding and planning the setup for distributing 1% of the token supply (1 billion tokens from a 100 billion total) to key groups: founders, team members, and advisors. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Reviewed Project Structure and Documentation**:
   - Read the README.md: Got setup instructions, deployment steps, and how to add beneficiaries (people's addresses) and claim tokens.
   - Read PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md: Learned about the overall architecture, testing (super high coverage at 98.29%), gas optimizations, and security features.
   - Read all core contracts:
     - `EscrowTeamTreasury.sol`: The main contract for handling vesting (3-year lock + 2-year release schedule).
     - `MockEscrowTokenNoMint.sol`: Simple token contract without auto-minting.
     - `ERC20Mock.sol`: Mock token for testing with 1 billion tokens pre-minted.
   - Key takeaway: The project is well-built for secure, efficient token distribution with vesting to prevent quick sell-offs.

2. **Discussed Adding Addresses for Groups**:
   - Explained how to add addresses (e.g., wallet addresses for founders, team, and advisors) using the `addBeneficiary` function in `EscrowTeamTreasury.sol`.
   - Covered best practices: Security (validate addresses), gas efficiency (use optimized loops), access control (owner-only changes), testing (run the 61 tests), and vesting (time-locked releases).
   - Suggested ways to organize groups: Assign allocations manually (e.g., 40% to founders, 40% to team, 20% to advisors) via code or deployment scripts.
   - No code changes yet—we've been planning and reading.

3. **Handled Initial Queries**:
   - Addressed your request for adding addresses and best practices.
   - Politely declined sharing personal contact info (like WhatsApp) since I'm an AI assistant.
   - Clarified misunderstandings and focused on the contract code.

**Overall Status**: We've analyzed the existing setup and planned how to extend it. The foundation is solid—no major issues found. Total time spent: Mostly reading and discussing (about 4 exchanges).

## What's Remaining
We haven't implemented any code changes yet, so here's what's left to make this fully functional for your needs:

1. **Customize for Specific Groups**:
   - Add logic to categorize addresses (e.g., separate structs or mappings for "founders," "team," and "advisors").
   - Edit `EscrowTeamTreasury.sol` or `MockEscrowTokenNoMint.sol` to include real addresses and allocations (you need to provide the actual wallet addresses).

2. **Code Edits and Testing**:
   - Modify contracts (e.g., add beneficiary addresses in the constructor or via functions).
   - Deploy to a testnet (e.g., using Hardhat) and run tests to ensure everything works.
   - Add any new features, like dynamic address management if needed.

3. **Deployment and Go-Live**:
   - Fund the treasury, add beneficiaries, and lock allocations.
   - Monitor for issues (e.g., using events for tracking).

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update README.md or PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md with any new changes or examples.

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours of coding/testing if we start now. No blockers—just need your input on addresses and priorities.

## Next Steps
- **Share Details**: Give me the actual addresses for founders, team, and advisors (e.g., a list like "Founder1: 0x123..., allocation: 100M tokens"). I can then edit the code accordingly.
- **Proceed with Edits**: Want me to modify `EscrowTeamTreasury.sol` to add group-specific logic or insert example addresses?
- **Questions?**: If this summary misses something or you want to focus on a specific part, let me know!

This keeps us on track—let me know how to move forward!
