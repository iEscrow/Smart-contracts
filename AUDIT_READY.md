## 4. Known Issues

### 4.1 Resolved Issues

#### 🔴 HIGH: Allowance Bypass in burnFrom()
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **Fix:** Proper allowance checking for non-BURNER_ROLE

#### 🟡 MEDIUM: Missing SafeERC20
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **Fix:** All transfers use SafeERC20

#### 🟡 MEDIUM: Invalid Burn Mechanism
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **Fix:** Burns to dead address instead of address(0)

#### 🟡 MEDIUM: Arithmetic Overflow in Penalties
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **Fix:** Penalty capping prevents underflow

### 4.2 Accepted Risks

#### ⚠️ Timestamp Dependence
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Description:** Contracts use `block.timestamp` for time-based logic
- **Mitigation:** Acceptable for timeframes > 15 minutes (presale rounds are days/weeks)
- **Status:** ACCEPTED

#### ⚠️ Centralization Risk
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Description:** Owner has significant control (pause, emergency functions)
- **Mitigation:** Required for presale management and emergency response
- **Recommendation:** Use multi-sig wallet and/or timelock for owner
- **Status:** ACCEPTED

#### ⚠️ Oracle Independence
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Description:** Token prices are set manually by owner, not oracle-based
- **Mitigation:** Fixed pricing eliminates oracle manipulation risk
- **Recommendation:** Update prices before each round if needed
- **Status:** ACCEPTED

### 4.3 Outstanding Test Failures

**10 tests currently failing (94% pass rate)**

1. MockERC20 deployment (1 test) - External test dependency
2. Presale edge cases (6 tests) - Business logic review needed
3. Staking penalty edge cases (3 tests) - Formula verification needed

**Note:** Core functionality tests all pass. Failures are in edge cases that require business logic clarification.
